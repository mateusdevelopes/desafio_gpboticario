A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The aplication has register and login page. But for default user are will returned when logIn is:

```
  {
    "id": 1,
    "createdAt": "2021-05-21T16:08:04.043Z",
    "user": "Mateus Lopes",
    "email": "mateusnlps@hotmail.com",
    "avatar": "https://cdn.fakercloud.com/avatars/akmalfikri_128.jpg",
    "supposedlyEncryptedPassword": "y8ezlxs8PpdQxV33",
    "fakeToken": "92232475-33c6-45c3-8c0c-c79dc48be296"
  }
```

It's because i used simple mockAPI.
  
## Mock

The aplication consume mockAPI: https://mockapi.io.
